# CP-with-Python-template

You can use this template for Competitive Coding with python, for fast IO and some handy libraries pre-imported.
You can use the print statements just the way you used to before but you cannot send a control string inside the input() function.
Which should not be a problem as we don't ever need to do that while doing CP.

Additional tip 1 : Select pypy3 to compile your code on online judges for better performance.

Additional tip 2 : Don't use pypy3 if the question demands heavy string operations like repeated concatenation, pypy3 sucks while dealing with strings.

Additional tip 3 : You could still use pypy3 is those questions, by using a list in place of string and later convert the list back to a str using .join().
